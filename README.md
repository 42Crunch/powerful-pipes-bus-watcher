In a nutshell `Powerful Pipes Watcher` is a multi broker watcher tool that connect them with UNIX pipes.

# Install

```bash
> pip install powerful-pipes-watch-bus 
```

# Quick Start

## WatchBus

Powerful Pipes Watcher read from a broker queue and re-send received data to the UNIX pipeline.

**Example**

```bash
> watch-bus -c redis:// -q my-queue 
```

Above command will connect to the localhost Redis at default port, at database number 1, and will listen for `my-queue` queue.

**Example with multiple queues**

```bash
> watch-bus -c redis:// -q my-queue -q second-queue 
```

With this command watch-bus will listen from two queues events.


## SendBus

Powerful Pipes SendBus read from stdin and re-send received JSON data to the Broker queue(s).

**Example**

```bash
> cat data.json | send-bus -c redis:// -q my-queue 
```

Above command will connect to the localhost Redis at default port, at database number 1, and will listen for `my-queue` queue.

**Example with multiple queues**

```bash
> cat data.json | send-bus -c redis:// -q my-queue -q second-queue 
```

With this command sendBus will send data to two broker queues.

# Supported brokers

Currently, supported brokers are:

- Redis

>   We'll be happy if you want to contribute adding new brokers! :)

## Redis examples

Bus connections for Redis should look like:

`redis://[[user]:[password]@][host][:port][/db=INTEGER]`

Default values:

- user: Null
- password: Null
- Host: 127.0.0.1
- port: 6379
- db: 1
